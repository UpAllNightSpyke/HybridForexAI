# Copilot Prompts

## Summary of Accomplishments

### Initial Setup and Debugging
- Ensured that the script (`DataScript1_01.mq5`) could correctly retrieve and write market data to a CSV file.
- Added debug prints to verify that the parameters were being set and retrieved correctly.

### Handling Moving Average
- Added functionality to retrieve and store Moving Average values.
- Ensured that the Moving Average parameters were correctly set and retrieved using global variables.

### Adding Alligator Indicator
- Added the Alligator indicator to the script.
- Defined input parameters for the Alligator indicator, including periods and shifts for the jaw, teeth, and lips, as well as the moving average method.
- Updated the `MarketData` structure to include fields for the Alligator indicator values (`alligatorJaw`, `alligatorTeeth`, `alligatorLips`).

### Correcting Parameter Handling
- Corrected the parameter count for the `iAlligator` function to include the moving average method.
- Ensured that the Alligator parameters were correctly set and retrieved using global variables.

### Updating the Expert Advisor (EA)
- Updated the EA (`DataCollectionEA.mq5`) to include input parameters for the Alligator indicator.
- The EA sets these parameters as global variables before triggering the script.
- Added debug prints in the EA to verify that the parameters were being set correctly.

### Writing to CSV
- Ensured that the script correctly writes the retrieved market data, including Moving Average and Alligator indicator values, to a CSV file.
- Verified that the CSV file was written properly with the expected data.

### Key Files Included
- `DataScript1_01.mq5`
- `DataCollectionEA.mq5`

### Next Steps
When you resume, you can continue by:
1. **Adding More Indicators**: If needed, you can add more indicators to the script and EA.
2. **Optimizing Data Collection**: You might want to optimize the data collection process or add more validation checks.
3. **Integrating with Other Systems**: If you plan to use the collected data in other systems (e.g., a neural network), you can start integrating the data collection process with those systems.

## Summary of Accomplishments - 09-15-2024

### Data Preparation
- Created a script (`data_preparation.py`) to load, clean, and normalize data from a TSV file.
- Saved the prepared data to a new TSV file (`PreparedModelData.tsv`).

### Model Training
- Created a script (`model_training.py`) to load the prepared data, split it into training and testing sets, train a Random Forest model, and evaluate its performance.
- Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Created a new script (`GridSearchModeling1_00.py`) to perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
- Found the best hyperparameters for the Random Forest model and evaluated its performance.
  - **Best Parameters**: `{'max_depth': None, 'min_samples_leaf': 1, 'min_samples_split': 2, 'n_estimators': 50}`
  - **Model Performance**: `Mean Squared Error: 0.00014814345890900302`, `R^2 Score: 0.9952321842174128`

### Model Persistence
- Updated the `GridSearchModeling1_00.py` script to save the trained model to disk using `joblib`.
- Checked the size of the saved model file.

### File Paths and Directories
- Ensured the prepared data and model files were saved to appropriate directories.
- Updated the `.gitignore` file to ignore the `venv/` and `models/` directories to avoid pushing them to the repository.

### Key Files Created/Updated
1. **data_preparation.py**
   - Loads, cleans, and normalizes data from a TSV file.
   - Saves the prepared data to `PreparedModelData.tsv`.

2. **model_training.py**
   - Loads prepared data, trains a Random Forest model, and evaluates its performance.

3. **GridSearchModeling1_00.py**
   - Performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
   - Saves the best model to `best_model.joblib`.
   - Prints the size of the saved model file.

4. **.gitignore**
   - Updated to ignore `venv/` and `models/` directories.

### Commands Used
1. **Running Data Preparation Script**:
   ```sh
   python data_preparation.py
